			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>I am currently in my last semester at Grand Valley State University and will be graduating with a degree in Marketing and Business Economics in less than four years. During my time at Grand Valley I have gained work related experience working with clients and in small groups. I am highly motivated and value oriented, and this is prevalent from what I have accomplished outside of the classroom. I saw that there were holes in my education that would need to be filled for my future career. So outside of school I made it a priority to learn the mechanics behind marketing with social media and how to code, so that I will be more prepared when I graduate.</p>
